# Singapore Integration Assistant (RAG-first)

Streamlit app that answers questions using a STRICT RAG-first workflow (LlamaCloudIndex) with Sea-Lion for generation.  
If the context is insufficient, it clearly shows a fallback notice.

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
